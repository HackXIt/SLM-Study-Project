# Project board

In our project, we used a Kanban board to track the status of our development.

## Setup

A GitHub project doesn't start with such a project board, it needs to be added for the logged in user.
In GitHub it's possible to have users representing a company or group, which is why that feature exists at the user-level.

A created project then needs to be linked with a repository and afterwards, issues created in said repository will show up on the board and can be dragged along.

## Board settings

We configured a description and README, so external viewers know what the project is about.
These are our project settings.

Since we used a private repository with managed access, the view had to be configured for the contributors of the project.

For the actual board, it is possible to configure the status field, but we left it at the default setting:

In a real life project, one would be able to configure development cycles, but we ended up not using it, because student life is chaotic and this projects implementation was too simple, so managing the time would have been pointless. *(An estimated total time for the project probably is around a few days for the whole team)*

We added the field anyways, for demonstration purposes:

## Board view & usage

This is a view of the board in the middle of development:![Project-board_1.png](https://github.com/HackXIt/SLM-Study-Project/blob/main/doc/attachments/Project-board_1.png)

To change the status of an issue, a collaborator can drag the issue-card from one column to the next:

This is repeated for all other states, an issue can have during development:

![Project-board_4.jpg](https://github.com/HackXIt/SLM-Study-Project/blob/main/doc/attachments/Project-board_4.jpg)

And that's how it was done throughout the project. ;)
